**Brute Force Solution**
```javascript
/**
 * Brute force solution to sort colors.
 * Sorts the array using JavaScript's built-in sort function.
 * The time complexity for the sort() method in JavaScript is `O(nlogn)`.
 * This is because JavaScript's sort() method typically uses the Timsort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, both of which have an average time complexity of `O(nlogn)`
 **/

var sortColorsBrute = function(nums) {
    nums.sort();
};
```
**Better Solution**
```javascript
/**
 * Better solution to sort colors using counting.
 * Counts the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s and then overwrites the array.
 * Time Complexity - `O(n)`
 **/

var sortColorsBetter = function(nums) {
    let zeros = 0, ones = 0;

    // Count occurrences of 0s and 1s
    for (const ele of nums) {
        if (ele === 0) zeros++;
        else if (ele === 1) ones++;
    }

    // Fill the array with 0s
    for (let i = 0; i < zeros; i++) {
        nums[i] = 0;
    }

    // Fill the array with 1s
    for (let i = zeros; i < zeros + ones; i++) {
        nums[i] = 1;
    }

    // Fill the remaining array with 2s
    for (let i = zeros + ones; i < nums.length; i++) {
        nums[i] = 2;
    }
};
```
### Optimal Solution (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)

#### Intuition
The Dutch National Flag algorithm is designed to sort an array containing only three distinct values (0, 1, and 2). The idea is to partition the array into three segments: one for 0s, one for 1s, and one for 2s. We achieve this by using three pointers to track the boundaries of these segments and efficiently sort the array in a single pass.

#### Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
     - `low` tracks the boundary of the last 0.
     - `mid` is the current element being processed.
     - `high` tracks the boundary of the first 2.

2. **Processing**:
   - Traverse the array with the `mid` pointer:
     - If `nums[mid]` is 0, swap it with `nums[low]`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
       - This operation ensures that 0s are moved to the beginning of the array.
     - If `nums[mid]` is 1, simply move the `mid` pointer to the next element.
       - This operation places 1s in their correct middle position.
     - If `nums[mid]` is 2, swap it with `nums[high]`, then decrement `high`.
       - This operation moves 2s to the end of the array.
   - Continue this process until `mid` surpasses `high`.

#### Complexity
- **Time complexity**: `(O(n))`, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, with each element being processed a constant number of times.
- **Space complexity**: `(O(1))`. The algorithm sorts the array in place without using additional space, apart from a few variables for the pointers.


```javascript
/**
 * Sorts an array with elements 0, 1, and 2 in place using the Dutch National Flag algorithm.
 
 **/
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    // Initialize pointers
    let low = 0;                 // Pointer for the boundary of the last 0
    let mid = 0;                 // Pointer for the current element under consideration
    let high = nums.length - 1;  // Pointer for the boundary of the first 2

    // Process the array until the mid pointer surpasses the high pointer
    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] === 0) {
            // If the current element is 0, swap it with the element at the low pointer
            // This moves the 0 to the left part of the array
            [nums[low], nums[mid]] = [nums[mid], nums[low]];
            // Move both low and mid pointers to the right
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] === 1) {
            // If the current element is 1, it is already in the correct middle part of the array
            // Just move the mid pointer to the right
            mid++;
        } else {
            // If the current element is 2, swap it with the element at the high pointer
            // This moves the 2 to the right part of the array
            [nums[mid], nums[high]] = [nums[high], nums[mid]];
            // Move the high pointer to the left
            high--;
        }
    }
};

/*
 Example usage:
 let nums = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0];
 sortColors(nums);
 console.log(nums); // Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
